Release cadence
---------------

We typically release patch and minor releases fortnightly and major releases every 3-6 months, though we may release more frequently as needed. As the project has matured the frequency of major releases (breaking changes) has slowed.

### Support policy

The NewsKit team will actively support the latest major release.
