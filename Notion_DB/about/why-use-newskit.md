Everything revolves around our customers. Everything we do should make their lives a little easier - and sometimes a lot.

Every design decision has the potential to include or exclude. We aim to make everything - from words to images to fonts - simple, clear and accessible for everyone.

### We’re open (and open source)

We share everything. We love feedback and contributions. And we look for great ideas everywhere.
