Foundations

Gradients
=========

Gradients, also known as colour transitions, are often used to provide realism, increase colour contrast, or to create the illusion of content fading into an interface or image.

Overview
--------

Gradient foundations consist of ‘base’ and ‘inverse’ styles.

### Base

*   Dark when used in a light theme
    
*   'Base' gradient tokens fade elements into the interface background
    

### Inverse

*   Light when used in a dark theme
    
*   'Inverse' gradient tokens fade elements into a dark background in a light theme

Accessibility considerations
----------------------------

When using gradients, ensure important UI elements like text and icons are legible without compromising the aesthetic.

Iconography
===========

Icons reinforce interactions and can provide additional context through visual cues.
