Foundations

Overlays
========

Overlays style UI elements. They can be decorative, but often have a functional use like communicating state on images or increasing background contrast when a component is layered above the interface (e.g. modal).

Overview
--------

Overlay foundations consist of tints in ‘base’ (these are dark when used in a light theme) and ‘inverse’ (light when used in a dark theme) styles.

* * *

### Tint

Tints make colours in a UI more or less intense. You can make text easier to read by increasing the contrast between foreground and background elements.  
  
'Base' tint tokens darken a background or element.  
  
'Inverse' tint tokens lighten a background or element.

How to use overlays
-------------------

Here’s how and when to use overlays:

* * *

Do make overlay contrast clear

Overlay contrasts should be distinct and clear. You can use them to obscure page content and emphasise an element for greater legibility (e.g. [modal](/components/modal/)).

* * *

Don’t obscure important UI elements

Overlays shouldn’t obscure the legibility of important UI elements, like text and icons.

* * *

Accessibility considerations
----------------------------

When using overlays, ensure important UI elements like text and icons are legible without compromising the aesthetic.
