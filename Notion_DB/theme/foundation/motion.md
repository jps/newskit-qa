Motion | NewsKit design system

Foundation

Motion
======

Motion creates movement and narrative in a product. It can guide users, enhance their experience and show them where to focus.

Overview
--------

You can use motion foundations in animations and transitions.  
  
Learn more about how motion foundations are applied to animations and transitions via [transition presets.](/theme/presets/transition-presets/)

Overrides

You can override default motion in the foundations. [Learn more here.](/theme/theming/creating-a-theme/)

Duration
--------

Timing is a matter of context. Consider the complexity of the action and the distance over which the animation occurs.

Common uses

You should use the [animation-duration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration) CSS property.

Timing
------

Timing controls the velocity of motion over its duration. It helps determine an animation’s feel and can help you mimic real-world physics by controlling how objects accelerate and decelerate as they move on the screen.  
  
NewsKit uses four types of timing:

How to use motion
-----------------

Here’s how and when to use motion:

* * *

Do use motion for emphasis

Motion should highlight important details and key points in a user’s journey.

* * *

Don’t distract the user

Motion shouldn’t distract or block the user from what they’re doing.

* * *

Don’t make motion too fast

Avoid motion that’s too fast for the user to follow.

* * *

Don’t make motion too slow

Avoid motion that’s too slow and prevents a user from advancing.

* * *

Accessibility
-------------

When creating custom animations using the motion foundations, consider the following to make sure everyone can use your product:

*   If motion plays an extensive role in your product, offer an option to reduce motion to improve usability for people who could be adversely affected by motion on screens
    
*   Consider the needs of people who are sensitive to motion. Think about avoiding large, abrupt movements, or moving multiple objects at the same time in different directions
