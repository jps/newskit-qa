Colours
=======

Colours help express brand identity and convey meaning to users.

Overview
--------

NewsKit lets you use bespoke colour palettes while encouraging accessibility.  
  
The design system applies colours through well-defined rules at both the theme and component level. These rules help establish a visual tone, indicate interaction and communicate meaning - while maintaining your brand identity.

Palette colours
---------------

Palette colours represent your brand’s colours.  
  
They’re linked to contextual colour tokens, which apply specific meaning (context).  
  
Consider whether a palette colour is best applied directly to an interface or as a contextual colour.

### Swatches

Use the swatches below to determine the accessibility of the palette colour in contrast to the background colour of this page:

*   Regular sized text on this colour will have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 or over
    

*   Regular sized text on this colour will have a contrast ratio of 3:1 or over
    

*   Regular sized text on this colour will be inaccessible
    

The WCAG AA standards define regular and large text sizes as:  
  
**Regular**  
Font size is at least 19px with a regular font weight or heavier.  
  
**Large**  
Font size is at least 19px with a bold font weight or 24px with regular font weight.

Accessibility
-------------

Choose your contextual colours carefully so important UI elements like text and icons are legible without compromising your aesthetic.  
  
Avoid yellow and orange for notices or warnings. Pairing these colours with white text does not allow for sufficient contrast. Aim for contrast ratios that meet [WCAG AA standards.](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html)

### Contrast for text and images of text

Standard text and images of text must have a minimum contrast of 4.5:1 between text colour and background, except for:

#### Large text

Large-scale text, and images of large-scale text, must have a minimum contrast of 3:1 between text colour and background.

#### Link text

Link text must have a minimum contrast of 3:1 between link text colour and the surrounding non-link text colour. Link text within body text (inline link) should be underlined.

#### Incidental text

Text, and images of text, that are part of an inactive component, purely decorative or part of a picture containing significant other visual content don’t have contrast requirements.

#### Logotypes

Text that’s part of a logo doesn’t have contrast requirements.

### Contrast for non-text elements

User interface components and graphical objects must have a minimum contrast of 3:1 against adjacent colours.
