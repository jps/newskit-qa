Theme overview | NewsKit design system

Theme
=====

NewsKit offers a robust and flexible theming system, enabling brands to retain a unique identity while building consistent, accessible products.

Foundations
-----------

NewsKit foundations define the look and feel of digital products. Foundations include borders, breakpoints, colours, fonts, motion, shadows, sizing and space.

[

### Borders



](/theme/foundation/borders/)

Borders can help direct attention and communicate state.

[

### Breakpoints



](/theme/foundation/breakpoints/)

Breakpoints allow content to adapt to different viewports responsively.

[

### Colours



](/theme/foundation/colours/)

Colours express brand identity and convey meaning.

[

### Design tokens



](/theme/foundation/design-tokens/)

Design tokens are used in the place of hard-coded values to allow a scalable and cohesive system.

[

### Fonts



](/theme/foundation/fonts/)

Fonts establish styles for content such as headlines and paragraphs.

[

### Gradients



](/theme/foundation/gradients/)

Gradients are a gradual blending from one colour to another, used to fade content and overlay images.

[

### Iconography

Icons reinforce interactions and can provide additional context through visual cues.

[

### Motion

[

### Outlines

Opacity creates translucent interface elements.

Overlays can be decorative or have a functional use like increasing the colour contrast of backgrounds.

Shadows provide visual cues about the distance between layers.
