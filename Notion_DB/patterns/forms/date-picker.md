How to use the date picker
--------------------------

Date picker should not be used for date of birth as navigating back through years can be cumbersome and lead to mistakes.

### Short term

If the user is required to select a date in the near future such as 1-2 months, the date picker should display fortnightly. This reduces cognitive load and allows the user to click/tap through each fortnight easily.

### Longer term

If the user is selecting a date more than 2 months in advance, the date picker should display per month so the user can click through each month. Including a year dropdown within the date picker should be avoided as it becomes cumbersome and awkward. It is also unlikely that the user would need to select a date in the distant future. [(See Google example)](https://material.io/components/date-pickers)

### Mobile devices

On mobile, users should be able to scroll or swipe through months as this is an easier interaction than tapping a small CTA.

#### Do

*   Clearly show a selected date via UI.
    
*   Use an appropriate date picker for relevant timescales.
    
*   Make it easy for users to change their mind after selecting a date.
    
*   Make navigating between months easy.
    
*   Consider the device the user is on.
    
*   Make it clear if a date is available unavailable/disabled via the UI.
    

#### Don’t

*   Use a date picker for date of birth.
    
*   Use a drop down for selecting the year.
    

### Date range

Although less commonly used in our industry, there may be occasions where a date range needs to be selected by the user. E.g holiday payments.  
  
These are displayed similarly to a date picker but need to allow for the following:

*   Show today’s date by highlighting the date in the calendar via UI.
    
*   Allow the user to easily browse through months.
    
*   First date selected should be the start date.
    
*   Second date selected should be the end date. (Users should not be allowed to select a date in the past).
    
*   The start and end date should be clearly highlighted in the calendar and visually highlight the days/dates in between the start and end date.
    

### Tip

Users should be able to change their date range by selecting a new date which becomes the new start date.

### Date range labelling

Use ‘to’ instead of a dash or slash in date ranges. ‘To’ is quicker to read than a dash, and it’s easier for screen readers.

### Error state variants

Please select a date (If left empty)  
  
Please select a date range (If left empty)
