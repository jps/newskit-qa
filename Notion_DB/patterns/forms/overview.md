Why use the Forms pattern?
--------------------------

### Consistency

All our brands have some form of data capture. Aligning our approach means there is one source of truth when building forms and capturing customer information.

### Ease of use

Customer data is only useful if it’s accurate. If we make our forms straightforward, it’s more likely our users will complete the form successfully.

### Best practice

Digital forms have been around for decades. We can rely on proven industry best practice and shared learning to supplement our own research.

### When should forms be used?

Forms should be used to capture information from customers based on clear business requirements/benefits. The data captured in Forms allows us to serve the customer or user.
