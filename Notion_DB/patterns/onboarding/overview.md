Onboarding overview
===================

Onboarding is the first impression a user has of a product or feature. It’s crucial to make it count.

First impressions matter
------------------------

Onboarding quickly demonstrates the value of a product or service, increasing the likelihood of user success.  
  
It’s more than just a flashy introduction, pointing out features, or even teaching new users how to use a product. It’s about helping users meet their unique goals and creating value. Onboarding guides users towards their ‘Aha! Moments’.  
  

An ‘Aha! Moment’ is a sudden insight or discovery. In this context, it describes a user’s emotional reaction when discovering the true value of a product

  
Onboarding should be task-orientated, taking into account both user and business goals. It‘s essential to consider the different groups of people coming to a product: What are they looking for? How can you make them feel welcome and productive?  
  
Think of an onboarding experience as a journey for the user. When defining these experiences, designing a component, or even writing copy, ask yourself: Is it relevant, contextual, dismissible, and digestible?
