Usage
-----

Hereâ€™s how and when to use the flag:

* * *

Do use flags to draw attention

Use flags to draw attention to a new feature, piece of content, or status change that may be of particular interest to a user.

* * *

Don't use flags for categorisation

Avoid using flags for categorisation other than status. Consider using a [tag](/components/tag/) instead

* * *

Don't make flags interactive

Use flags as a non-interactive status indicator.

* * *

SEO considerations
------------------

*   Ensure icons have alt text applied.
