Options
-------

The link has options that can be used to provide an appropriate experience for different use cases.

### Inline and standalone links

Links can be either inline (within a paragraph or body text) or standalone.  
  
The inline link doesn't have any text cropping applied. It is recommended to crop the whole paragraph, where the inline link appears.  
  
The standalone link has text cropping applied by default.

### External link

Navigates the user to an external site. Can be inline or standalone, indicated with a trailing icon.  
  

If the external prop is enabled, it automatically checks if the passed href is external or internal to the website where the link is used. If the href is external, an icon indicating this will be rendered after (trailing) the label.

* * *

Do use inline links within paragraphs

Use inline links within paragraphs or sentences to link to content on the same page or other pages.

* * *

Do use standalone links within navigation components

Use standalone links outside of body content, for example within navigational components such as menus, headers, and footers.

* * *

Do use icons for external links

Use a trailing icon to indicate the link takes the user to an external site.

Accessibility considerations
----------------------------

The link has the following accessibility considerations:  
  

*   [Avoid opening links in a new tab or window](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html), as it can be disorienting for users and can cause problems for users who are unable to visually perceive that the new tab has opened.
    
*   If there is a need for a link to open in a new tab, include the words 'opens in new tab' within the link text.

Description

WAI-ARIA

By default, there is no aria-label set in the link component. The text inside the anchor will be read by the screen reader, so it is important that links are descriptive. This is so that there is a clear expectation about where the link will take the user. If the text is not descriptive enough, an `aria-label` will be necessary to understand where the link is taking the user to.
