How to contribute
=================

NewsKit is open source and anyone can contribute to the community index.

NewsKit welcomes contributions
------------------------------

We encourage contributions of code, design and guidance. To lower the barrier to contribution we don’t have contribution criteria. But before submitting a component we’d ask you to consider:  
  

*   Adaptability: could this component be useful to other products?
    
*   Consistency: is built for reuse using NewsKit tokens and base components?
    
*   Accessibility: does it meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards?
    

How to contribute to the community index
----------------------------------------

Complete this [Google Form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWRmUgUEuj0rufLVZ2QFvUF3MKJc7Hcc0Ll0H39Xsoc0bLhQ/viewform) We need you to provide:  
  

*   Component name
    
*   Description
    
*   Link to GitHub, Storybook, Confluence or wherever the contribution is stored
    
*   Your details so we can get in touch
    

  
  
We will review and add the component to the [community listing page](/components/community/community-index/) so everyone can access it.

Ongoing maintenance
-------------------

You are responsible for the ongoing maintenance of your contribution. If it proves useful to other teams we might consider upgrading it to the core library.
