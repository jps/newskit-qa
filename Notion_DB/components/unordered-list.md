Interactive demo
----------------

This demo allows you to preview the unordered list component, its variations, and configuration options.

*   NewsKit provides components, guidelines and standards to enable digital product teams to create high-quality, consistent products quickly. NewsKit is built on modular design principles and backed by best practice guidance for design and development.
    
*   Unordered list items are not numbered, so use them in instances where ordering is not a factor. Where items are required to appear in numerical order use an ordered list.

Usage
-----

Hereâ€™s how and when to use the unordered list:

* * *

Do use for non-sequential lists

Unordered list items are not numbered, so use them in instances where ordering is not a factor. Where items are required to appear in numerical order use an ordered list.

* * *

Don't use for numerically ordered lists

Avoid unordered lists in instances where items are required to appear in numerical order. Instead use an ordered list.

* * *

Do use for bulleted lists that are easier to read

Use unordered lists to break up blocks of related content into manageable bulleted items to make the information easier for users to read.

Accessibility considerations
----------------------------

The unordered list has the following accessibility considerations:  
  

*   The ul element is for [grouping a collection of items](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20081103/H48) that don't need to be in a specific numerical order.
    
*   Unordered list are not keyboard operable unless the list items themselves are operable e.g. with links.
    
*   Using unordered lists purely as a means of indenting text is discouraged. Refer to [Lists in HTML documents 10.2 in WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/lists.html#h-10.2) This is a stylistic issue and indenting of text can be achieved using the [text block component.](https://newskit.ceng-dev.newsuk.tech/components/text-block/)
