Example
-------

Here are some examples of the divider in action:

Divider with stack

Use this approach where you want equal spacing between elements. This example shows how to use the divider inside a stack. Use flow=horizontal-stretch and wrap the divider in a stackChild to stretch it to the height of the container.

Horizontal divider with block

Use this approach where you want irregular spacing between elements. This example shows the divider as a visual separator between two block elements. Use the container styledBlock to constrain the divider's width.

Vertical divider with block

Use this approach where you want irregular spacing between elements. This example shows the vertical divider as a visual separator between two inline blocks. Use the inline divider container to constrain the height of the block.
