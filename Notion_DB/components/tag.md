States
------

The tag has the following states:

### Base

The tag has a base state. This is the base style of the tag before it has been interacted with by a user.

### Hover

The tag has a hover state. The style of the tag changes to visually communicate and provide feedback to the user that the tag is an interactive element.

### Focus

The tag in a focus state communicates that a user has highlighted a tag, using an input method such as a keyboard or voice.

### Active

The tag has an active state. The style of the tag changes to visually communicate and provide feedback to the user that the tag has been interacted with.

Behaviours
----------

The following guidance describes how a tag behaves.

### Fixed and full width

Tags can be displayed in two ways, but consideration should be made to how they will respond and react to containers around them:  
  
Fixed width - size dependent on content (label, icons).  
  
Full width - size responsive to the container it is applied to.

Usage
-----

Hereâ€™s how and when to use tags:

* * *

Do make sure tags relate to the content

Tags should always have a direct relationship to the content they represent.

* * *

Don't make tags too wide

Avoid using full-width tags in wide containers. They are generally appropriate for small devices or contained components.

* * *

Do make sure tags have sufficient clearance

Do allow a sufficient hit area when placing two or more tags inline make sure they are a sufficient size or have spacing between them to avoid users accidentally hitting the wrong tag.

* * *

Don't have multiple words for labels

Avoid having multiple words for tag labels. They should be short and clear.

* * *
