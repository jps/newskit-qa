Usage
-----

Hereâ€™s how and when to use the ordered list:

* * *

Do use for numerically ordered lists

Ordered list items are numbered, so use them in instances where items need to appear in numerical order.

* * *

Do use to break up sequential information

Use ordered lists to break up blocks of sequential information into manageable numbered items.

* * *

Accessibility considerations
----------------------------

The ordered list has the following accessibility considerations:  
  

*   The `ol` element is for [grouping a collection of items](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20081103/H48) that appear in sequential numerical order.
    
*   Ordered lists are not keyboard operable unless the list items themselves are operable e.g. with [links](https://newskit.co.uk/components/link/).
    
*   Using unordered lists purely as a means of indenting text is discouraged. Refer to [Lists in HTML documents 10.2 in WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/lists.html#h-10.2) This is a stylistic issue and indenting of text can be achieved using the [text block component.](https://newskit.ceng-dev.newsuk.tech/components/text-block/)
