Options
-------

The scroll component has options that can be used to provide an appropriate experience for different use cases.

### Orientation

The scroll component can be displayed horizontally or vertically, depending on the desired scroll direction.

### Control visibility

Controls (icon buttons) can be enabled on the scroll. If enabled, they can be set to appear persistently or on hover.

### Scroll bar visibility

A scroll bar can be displayed in the scroll component to provide users with extra context of the horizontal or vertical position of the content being scrolled.

### Scroll step distance

Scroll step distance can be adjusted to increase or decrease the distance scrolled when the controls are clicked.

### Scroll snap alignment

*   `start` aligns the scroll item snapping position to the left.
    
*   `center` centers the scroll item snapping position.
    
*   `end` aligns the scroll item snapping position to the right.
    

\`ScrollSnapAlignment\` can be used inside to a scroll component to individually set where the component should align.

Behaviours
----------

The following guidance describes how the scroll component behaves.

### Overlays

Overlays are displayed when content is overflowing at either the start, the end, or both.  
  
You can change the style or visually hide the overlays by overriding the [style preset.](/theme/presets/style-presets/)

Usage
-----

Hereâ€™s how and when to use scroll:

* * *

Do hide scroll controls for mobile

Hide controls on mobile breakpoints to encourage a user to swipe, as this is common mobile device behaviour.

* * *

Do use an appropriate step distance

When using controls, use an appropriate step distance if all scrollable items have similar widths.

* * *

Accessibility considerations
----------------------------

The scroll component has the following accessibility considerations:

Focus order

Scroll controls are not focussable. When the scroll element is in focus, users are able to scroll the element natively e.g. keyboard, mouse scroll wheel.
