Experimentation Web
===================

Overview
--------

[Optimizely Web Experimentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/web/docs/introduction) is front-end A/B and multi-page experimentation product. The Experimentation Web component is a non-visual component for the injection of the Optimizely Web 3rd party script and custom script for enabling Optimizely based on cookie.

Prerequisites
-------------

To utilise this component you will need to have the relevant Optimizely Web project in the [Optimizely platform](https://app.optimizely.com/) and Optimizely script CDN URL.

Usage
-----

The component should be added at the top-level of the project in the `<head>` tag. The Optimizely script should run before the other scripts to avoid flickering and unexpected DOM changes on the page.

Itâ€™s important to load the Optimizely script before the utag script, so that the GA `page-view` event can report on the running experiments.

Props
-----

optimizelyWebConfigobject

The config object that initialises Optimizely Web. Required parameters: **scriptCdn**.

scriptCdnstring

Optimizely script CDN URL. The URL can be found in _Settings \-> Implementation_ for every web project in the Optimizely platform. More information on how to retrieve the script can be found [here](https://documentation.sourcepoint.com/web-implementation/sourcepoint-set-up-and-configuration-v2) .

reactHelmetReact.ComponentType<{script?: Array<any>}>

By default the Experimentation Web component will inject its scripts by rendering script tags. However, if your project is using [React Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) you can pass the Helmet component in and the scripts will render using that component.

asyncboolean

If you are looking for better page-load performance, you might consider loading Optimizely as a non-blocking resource (async). However, this sometimes causes page flickering, which in turn can generate sub-optimal user experiences. We strongly recommend to load the Optimizely snippet as non-blocking. By default the component loads Optimizely synchronously.
