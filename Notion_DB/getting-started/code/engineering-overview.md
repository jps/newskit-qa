Engineering overview
====================

The NewsKit design system provides an npm package that exports a library of reusable React components and utilities that can be used as building blocks to compose web applications.

Why build products with NewsKit?
--------------------------------

Systems thinking is at the core of digital product design. NewsKit improves design consistency and developer efficiency across teams with considered, reusable solutions, and shared best practices. The result is more robust products and more time for innovation.

### Accessible

NewsKit components follow [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), [WAI Aria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) and[Aria-practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/). Components are AA compliant with A11Y features built-in including props to extend their flexibility if required.

### Adaptive

NewsKit has an extensive[theming system](/theme/overview/) that enables customization of style and layout. Additionally components support a range of properties to customise behaviour.

### Productive

Carefully crafted components ensure that teams using NewsKit can rapidly iterate on product requirements through re-use of common functionality. This promotes both consistency and common language across product development teams.
