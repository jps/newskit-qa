Code for accessibility
======================

Building to WCAG standards maintains quality and supports assistive technologies.

Build accessible code
---------------------

When building for the web, consider:

*   Does mark-up convey meaning and structure?
    
*   Are all interactive elements keyboard accessible?
    
*   Do images have `alt` tags?
    
*   Is there clear feedback after submitting a form?
    
*   Do videos have captions?
    
*   Can animations/transitions be turned off?
    
*   Can audio levels be modified, or audio muted on page load?
    
*   Does it render across different devices?
    

  

Considerations will vary depending on what you are building.  
See the [a11y project checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) for a complete list of code considerations.
