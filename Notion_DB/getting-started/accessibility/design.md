Design for accessibility
========================

Design provides the foundations for accessibility.

Design accessible websites
--------------------------

When designing for the web, consider:  
  

*   Do all elements meet colour contrast to an AA standard?
    
*   Does content have a clear order and hierarchy?
    
*   Are interactive elements easy to identify?
    
*   Are navigation options clear and consistent?
    
*   Are layouts responsive to different viewports?
    

  

Considerations will vary depending on what you are designing.  
See the [a11y project checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) for a complete list of design considerations.
