Getting started with accessibility
==================================

Equal access for everyone.

What is accessibility?
----------------------

Accessibility is making sure that all our colleagues and customers have equal access to our digital products and services. This is achieved by designing and building to industry standards which maintains quality and supports assistive technologies.  
  
This guide links out to resources to help you design, build, write and test for accessibility.

### An introduction

If you're new to accessibility, check out these guides from W3C:

*   [Introduction to web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)
    
*   [How people with disabilities use the web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/)

### Which standards do we follow?

  

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

  

WCAG is the international shared standard for web accessibility. Newskit core components are tested to a WCAG 2.1 Level AA standard.

[WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)  
  
  

WAI ARIA

  

ARIA is a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to make web content accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technologies.

### Which laws must we comply with?

UK Equality Act protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. It covers the provision of digital services and therefore accessibility.
