Write for accessibility
=======================

Clear copy in plain language benefits everyone.

Write accessible content
------------------------

When writing for the web, consider:

*   Is copy clear, concise and in plain language?
    
*   Does copy follow a logical order?
    
*   Do headings convey meaning and structure?
    
*   Do images have meaningful alt text?
    
*   Are page titles and links unique and informative?
    
*   Do videos have captions?
    
*   Do forms have error messages that clearly describe what went wrong and how to fix the problem?
    

  

Considerations will vary depending on what you are writing.  
See the [a11y project checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) for a complete list of content considerations.
